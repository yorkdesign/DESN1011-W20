IMAGES 101:

******************************** 
Which image type should I save?
********************************
1. If an image is created only out of shapes/vectors that 
   can be live edited in illustrator or Figma: save it as an SVG

2. If an image is a photograph or complex image with textures, 
   gradients, etc, save it as either a PNG or JPG. 
   
   PNG will allow you to save an image and keep the transparency 
   in the background. 

   If an image has a clear/transparent background and you save it 
   as a JPG it will give you an image with a white background instead.

3. If an image requires simple animation, keep it's format as a gif.

************************************
What size should I save the image as?
************************************
1. SVGs can be any size as they are scalable. Generally, export it at 
   the exact size it will mostly be viewed at.
2. For JPGs, and PNGs:
    A. In Figma export at 2x.
    B. In photoshop or illustrator, export it at twice the size of 
       exactly what size you intend the image to be viewed.


*********************
What about FILE size?
*********************
1. Compress all JPG and PNG images here: https://tinypng.com/ or 
   here: https://compressor.io/compress. 
   
   Download the compressed images and then replace them in your 
   images folder.
   
   I prefer tinypng.com as a compressor, but compressor.io has a 
   larger file size limit if you have a big guy.
   
   You do not need to compress SVGs.
