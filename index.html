								<h4 class="h5">Responsive design (5%)</h4>
								<h5 class="h4">Due: March 31, 2020</h5>
								<p>In Figma, re-design your major project at least 50% of your content for a different size screen. If you did a desktop/computer sized design, design for mobile (320-411px wide); if you did a mobile size, design for desktop (1200px wide).
								<p>This will not have to be coded nor will it need to be similar to how you are coding any responsiveness in your final project.</p>
								<p>We are looking for considerations on translating your design to a different screen size that is considerate of size of objects and text that is both readable, understandable, and still impactful.</p>
								<p><small>Due to the conditions of the reduced class, you have the option to not do this assignment and the weighting for all your other assignments will equally rise to make up this 5%.
									If you have any questions, please reach out. Also please let your instructor know if you are choosing to forgoe this assignment.</small></p>

								<h4 class="h5">Developed major project (20%)</h4>
								<h5 class="h4">Due: March 31, 2020</h5>
								<p>Time to take your design into development. It is very likely that you will need to
									connect with your instructor for a consultation into what you need to look into to
									code your specific project.</p>
								<p>It is understood that you may have to make adjustments to your design based on what
									your skill level is in development.</p>
								<p>We are looking for well exectued code, accuracy to your design where appropriate
									(understanding more intense functionality and positioning may have to be scaled
									back), responsiveness where appropriate, and finally the overall user experience of
									using/browsing your site.</p>
								<p><small>The entire site is not required to be responsive as some projects are very
										size specific, but an effort should be made to include responsiveness to an
										extent (between some widths). Again, connect with your instructor to establish
										these constraints. Everyone's project is a little different.</small></p>

									<h5>Part 1</h5>
									<p>Create a new basic HTML file creating a page for a <strong>news/review/story
											article</strong>. Link CSS to this and style it. The content and images can
										be directly copied from another site, however the design should be entirely
										original. Don't worry about sidebars or promotional content. Include a dummy
										non-functional comment section (view-only) with at least 4 comments by different
										users.</p>
									<h6 class="h4">You sould demonstrate:</h6>
									<ul>
										<li>Understanding of basic CSS as well as HTML</li>
										<li>Understanding of the position property</li>
										<li>Understanding of when to use % and when to use rem</li>
										<li>Understanding of display: flex and other flex properties (this does not mean
											to use all variations of the flex properties, but to choose which you want
											to achieve a design)</li>
									</ul>
									<h6 class="h4">Requirements:</h6>
									<ul>
										<li>CSS file should have * {box-sizing: border-box;} at the top of the file.
										</li>
										<li>Website should be responsive (no HORIZONTAL scrollbar; looks visually
											un-broken)
											between 992px - 1300px (use % to achieve this)</li>
										<li>Use at least one <a

										download from here). You can view documentation on how to use it on that site.
										However, recommended for download, use <a href="docs/flexbox.zip" download>this
											link</a> instead. You can ask your instructor for help intro-ing this. A
										beginning explainer is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmPmwdshCMw"

								<p>Wireframe your entire project. Every scene,the entirety of the project, should be
									wireframed for final submission.
								</p>
								<p>We are looking for you to map out exactly your entire project without spending time
									on the visual design elements such as colour, font choice, and graphic creation
									(however you may want to think about average font size). This will be your
									blueprint.</p>
								<p>We are looking for clear communication so that we can understand by looking at your
									wireframe, the intended design's structure/layout. We are looking for smart layout
									designs and creative thinking about where to place items on the page that align with
									your vision. You should already be thinking and applying the previous 3 lectures in
									these wireframes on usability, interaction principles, and the basics.</p>
								<p>We recommend doing it in figma with a grid. Your wireframe will likely be more
									realized in this form. But we do absolutely accept highly detailed sketches if you
									work better in that format. Please refer to first few slides in the week 3 lecture
									for reference on what detail we are looking for in wireframes</p>

								However <strong>you do not have to have every scene wireframed for next week</strong>.
							</p>
							<p>This can be sketched on paper or created on Figma.</p>
							<p><strong>Recommended to do it digitally on Figma</strong> (you do not need to worry about
								components for this). However, if you are able to more clearly work in sketches, feel
								free to do it as paper sketches. You will not be docked marks, however be sure to make
								it detailed and percise.</p>
							<p>If sketched on paper, use a template so that you are working in the same size across
								different mocked up screens.</p>
							<p>This wireframe should be entirely grayscale (no colour). This is <strong>not
									design</strong>. Do not get caught up in the design minuitia, focus on the placement
								of your items and how much space you want them to take up. Make sure it is clear to the
								instructor. Do not inclue any photos, illustrations, or graphical elements.</p>
							<p>Note: watch your type size. Even though it is not final type styles or sizes, you should
								be thinking about it. Your wireframes shouldn't be all in 12px font-size.</p>
							<p><strong>Refer to the readings</strong> for assistance on creating wireframes. There are
								many more helpful articles and videos on how to create a good wireframe.</p>
