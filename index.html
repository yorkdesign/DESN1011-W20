									<p>Create a new basic HTML file creating a page for a <strong>news/review/story
											article</strong>. Link CSS to this and style it. The content and images can
										be directly copied from another site, however the design should be entirely
										original. Don't worry about sidebars or promotional content. Include a dummy
										non-functional comment section (view-only) with at least 4 comments by different
										users.</p>
									<h6 class="h4">You sould demonstrate:</h6>
									<ul>
										<li>Understanding of basic CSS as well as HTML</li>
										<li>Understanding of the position property</li>
										<li>Understanding of when to use % and when to use rem</li>
										<li>Understanding of display: flex and other flex properties (this does not mean
											to use all variations of the flex properties, but to choose which you want
											to achieve a design)</li>
									</ul>
									<h6 class="h4">Requirements:</h6>
									<ul>
										<li>CSS file should have * {box-sizing: border-box;} at the top of the file.
										</li>
										<li>Website should be responsive (no scrollbar; looks visually un-broken)
											between 900px - 1200px (use % to achieve this)</li>
										<li>Use at least one <a

										However, recommended for download, use <a href="docs/flexbox.zip" download>this

								<h4 class="h3">Wireframes: 15%</h4>
								<p>Wireframe your entire project. Every scene,the entirety of the project, should be
									wireframed for final submission.
								</p>
								<p>We are looking for you to map out exactly your entire project without spending time
									on the visual design elements such as colour, font choice, and graphic creation
									(however you may want to think about average font size). This will be your
									blueprint.</p>
								<p>We are looking for clear communication so that we can understand by looking at your
									wireframe, the intended design's structure/layout. We are looking for smart layout
									designs and creative thinking about where to place items on the page that align with
									your vision. You should already be thinking and applying the previous 3 lectures in
									these wireframes on usability, interaction principles, and the basics.</p>
								<p>We recommend doing it in figma with a grid. Your wireframe will likely be more
									realized in this form. But we do absolutely accept highly detailed sketches if you
									work better in that format. Please refer to first few slides in the week 3 lecture
									for reference on what detail we are looking for in wireframes</p>

							<p>Wireframe your entire project. Every scene should be wireframed for final submission.
								However <strong>you do not have to have every scene wireframed for next week</strong>.
							</p>
							<p>This can be sketched on paper or created on Figma.</p>
							<p><strong>Recommended to do it digitally on Figma</strong> (you do not need to worry about
								components for this). However, if you are able to more clearly work in sketches, feel
								free to do it as paper sketches. You will not be docked marks, however be sure to make
								it detailed and percise.</p>
							<p>If sketched on paper, use a template so that you are working in the same size across
								different mocked up screens.</p>
							<p>This wireframe should be entirely grayscale (no colour). This is <strong>not
									design</strong>. Do not get caught up in the design minuitia, focus on the placement
								of your items and how much space you want them to take up. Make sure it is clear to the
								instructor. Do not inclue any photos, illustrations, or graphical elements.</p>
							<p>Note: watch your type size. Even though it is not final type styles or sizes, you should
								be thinking about it. Your wireframes shouldn't be all in 12px font-size.</p>
							<p><strong>Refer to the readings</strong> for assistance on creating wireframes. There are
								many more helpful articles and videos on how to create a good wireframe.</p>

								<h4 class="h3">Rough Sketches: 2.5%</h4>
								<p>Slightly more thought about ideas roughly sketched out. It can very rough. Think of
									it as an expanded proposal with a clearer sense of how you will be organizing the
									information. These are not wireframes. Every detail does not need to be put down.
									Big picture. These rough sketches should simply communicate, <strong><em>What is
											your concept?</em></strong> without getting into the design or nitty gritty.

						<h1 class="slug">Major project</h1>
						<h2 class="h1">Project brief</h2>
						<p class="large">Create a digital interactive piece demonstrating key events of a movie (e.g. a
							timeline). The organization and choice of events is entirely up to you. Avoid simply using
							screenshots with no form of image treatment or editing from the movie. Creative
							representation of the events (illustrations, collage, typographic, colour, etc) is
							encouraged.</p>

						<p>Be mindful of your design system when representing different events, while you may decide to
							treat them visually different, there should be an underlying system so that someone could
							still tell that the event still belongs on your webpage.</p>
